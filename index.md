### By Kiel Wells

An attempt to document things I find interesting/noteworthy.

I am a person who spends too much time in my life reading about policy, but I’m not clever enough to post anything useful to twitter. Not only that, but I have tweets set to auto-delete, and the only people who follow me won’t retweet anything I say. Piling on a joke always feels bad and gratuitous, so I don’t do that.

Welcome, and hopefully it's worth your time.
