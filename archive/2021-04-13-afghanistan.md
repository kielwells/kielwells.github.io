# Better Late Than...

I love so much that [we are apparently leaving Afghanistan](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/13/us/biden-news-today) *no later than* 20 years after we kicked over a hornet's nest on the world stage, for the simple reason that nobody in D.C. will be able to stomach future headlines about our two-decade war. I don't want to be in Afghanistan as much as the next anti-war person, but it's so goddamn funny to me that it has to be one-day shy of being anywhere close to eligible for the full 20-year mark! Ten years? Fine! 15? Sure, send the troops back into the meat-grinder! Did a father and his son both commemorate serving a tour simultaneously in the region, when the son was born AFTER 9/11? Abso-fucking-lutely, they did!

But 20 years, *in print*, in the NY Times? Nope, no sir, cannot do. Get those people outta there!

But also, fuck you to the Afghan and Taliban governments who mandated a May 1 withdrawl. We sure as shit won't meet that, because fuck off.

We should have never been there, we should have never kept fighting, and we should have brought those folks home yesterday. What a colossal waste of human lives.
