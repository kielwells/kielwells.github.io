# Obviously, It's a Failure

I'm not an expert in military procurement, but obviously when you bits like [this](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/04/sitrep-is-the-f-35-now-officially-a-failure/) come out, you know something is well past the point of failure and into just pure graft/corruption mode.

I'm not sure how you could look at any advanced weapon system acquisition in the US in the past few generations and not see it as a huge give-away to weapons companies and then Congresspeople, in that direct order. These systems are stupid, awful, expensive, and deadly to their operators, in the pursuit of waging a war that won't or shouldn't ever happen.

We should just turn the DOD spigot off until we can sort the entire imperial war machine & global climate disaster mess out. Move all those weapons operators and maintainers over into real jobs like nuclear power plant operators or solar panel installers.

You know, useful stuff.
