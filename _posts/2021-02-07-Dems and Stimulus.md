# Dems and Stimulus

You know, I see shit like [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/06/business/economy/housing-insecurity.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage) and I get furious at the party who holds the majority in the three major governing institutions in this country. Democrats claim to want to solve problems, and they claim they want to help people, yet the party refuses to secure housing for all people. Rather, they’d seemingly prefer to have people who live at the margins remain indefinitely insecure, because that helps drive the bottom line of major employers who want wages to stay as low as possible. Think of the kind of stimulus we could provide to the average worker if we simply said to them, “you no longer have to worry about finding a safe place to live, as that will be provided for you.” Truly, all the money that people put towards attempting to secure their homes, apartments, condos, etc., could be spent in the world on literally anything else they needed to buy in order to continue to attempt to survive. Furthermore, no person needs to own a home they don’t plan on living in, or needs to extract the extra cash from a person who is at the whim of a market to find a place to live.

I don’t know, maybe it’s dumb to think that people should have a right to a safe place to live, because it sure seems like everyone in power thinks it is.
