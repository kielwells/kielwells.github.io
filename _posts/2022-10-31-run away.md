# Run For the... Mastodon?

Elon's taken over twitter, so everyone online is kvetching over where to go next, rather than considering, like, maybe don't be online at all anymore? Gotta say though, twitter is kinda more funny when the biggest asshole you know is in charge of it and tries to think up ways to annoy all the people he hates and hate him, while still making money from them.

Charging people rent for blue checks is delightful too, because it forces the bluechecks into a corner: pay to stay Verified (TM) or leave and no longer be a member of what they consider to be the 'public discourse'. It's an honestly perfect grift for Elon to steal money from the likes of every public agency and Matt Yglesias at the same time.

If I didn't hate billionaires, I'd love it.
