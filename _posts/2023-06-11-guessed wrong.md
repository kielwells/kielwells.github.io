# Guess Not

I definitely mis-read the situation around twitter vis-a-vis [this post](kielwells.com/2022-10-31-run away.md). I never would have expected that a blue check mostly now signifies the presence of a complete idiot, while all the formerly verified people I followed ran away from the verification process post-haste.

It is useful to use the blue checks as an identifier now of who I should be blocking by default rather than having to analyze their posts to determine it, so that's nice.

Also, mastadon is boring cause all the tone-police scolds ran off twitter to set up their own safe space enclave there, where nobody trolls their ideological opponents, because nobody has any. Meh.

I set up a nostr account, but it's mostly all weird bitcoiners. The technology is kind of fascinating, to some degree, but I think the idea of 'posts never go away' is a bit silly. I've deleted the majority of my tweets over the years, and I think I'm better off for it, but I also have basically no following online.

All of this is in service to the fact that I'm not reading reddit anymore, so mostly I just need some kind of new thing to fill that space in my day. *shrug*
