# Markdown Editors

It sure seems difficult to find decent markdown editors on Windows. My guess is people on this OS never consider deliberate, purposeful aesthetic choices in conjunction with writing applications both they and others might be interested in using.

It's sure hard to figure these damn things out, that's for sure.

Maybe VSCode will work, though? It's got a nice little file browser on the left side and seems to automagically allow me to update files where appropriate.

Whatever I do, I need to find a way to convince myself to write more on a blog rather than on stupid internet platforms I don't or can't own, going forward.
