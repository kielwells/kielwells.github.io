# Markdown Editors

It sure seems difficult to find decent markdown editors on Windows. My guess is people on this OS never consider deliberate, purposeful aesthetic choices in conjunction with writing applications both they and others might be interested in using.

It's sure hard to figure these damn things out, that's for sure. A defining criteria for me is to make sure the app is somewhat native to the platform it's installed on, and follows whatever best practices conventions might be in place, while remaining OS-agnostic and focuses mainly on text files in a folder. You wouldn't think that's being too nitpicky, but maybe it is?

Right now, the git repository this is based on lives on an iCloud Drive folder that syncs across all my devices, including my Windows one, which is kinda incredibly convenient.

Maybe VSCode will work, though? It's got a nice little file browser on the left side and seems to automagically allow me to update files where appropriate.

Whatever I do, I need to find a way to convince myself to write more on a blog rather than on stupid internet platforms I don't or can't own, going forward.
