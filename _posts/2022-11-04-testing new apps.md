# Markdown Editors

It sure seems difficult to find decent markdown editors on Windows. My guess is people on this OS never consider deliberate, purposeful aesthetic choices in conjunction with writing applications both they and others might be interested in using.

It's kinda hard to figure these damn things out, at least for me. I'd like any app I'd want to use to be native (or native-feeling) and follow whatever best practices or conventions might be in place, while remaining OS-agnostic and focuses mainly on text files in a folder. You wouldn't think that's being too nitpicky, but maybe it is?

Right now, the git repository this is based on lives on an iCloud Drive folder that syncs across all my devices, including my Windows one, which is kinda incredibly convenient.

Maybe VSCode will work, though? It's got a nice little file browser on the left side and seems to automagically allow me to update files where appropriate.

Whatever I do, I need to find a way to convince myself to write more on a blog rather than on stupid internet platforms I don't or can't own, going forward.

At least this has an edit capability, lol.
