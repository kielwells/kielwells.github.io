# Sleepy Joe's Checks

1.9 trillion dollars is nothing to sneer at, by any means. That's a good chunk of change dumped out of the governmental coffers and into the hands of (some) of the people! A big part of that is the cash-in-hand stimulus to a large portion of people, people who might be willing to look at that check, look at the name on the front of it, and say "Hey, it's not so bad that I got this, after all!" They might then consider voting for the people or party that gave it to them!

It seems like it'd be good politics to take direct and blatant credit for the good works a party might undertake, even if it's only a single fleeting check.

Now, ol' Donny Deals knew this. He knew that people would see his name on some checks, and they wouldn't care about the "politics" around it, and they'd think favorably of him when they cash those checks.

How about Joe? Well, in the case of "people who don't know how to politick", you get [this](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/09/us/biden-administration/white-house-says-bidens-name-wont-appear-on-future-stimulus-checks).

> “He did not want his name to appear on the checks,” the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters, “and he didn’t think that was a priority.”

Neither is winning elections, Jen, apparently.

Good luck in '22!
