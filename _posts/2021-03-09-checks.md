# Sleepy Joe's Checks

1.9 trillion dollars is nothing to sneer at, by any means. That's a good chunk of change dumped out of the governmental coffers and into the hands of (some) of the people. Part of that being the cash-in-hand stimulus to a pretty large portion of the people, people who might be willing to look at that check, look at the name on the front of it, and say "Hey, it's not so bad that I got this, after all!"

It seems like it'd be good politics to take direct and obvious credit for the good works one might do in the world, even if it's nothing too much in the grand scheme of things.

Now, ol' Donny Deals knew this. He knew that people will see his name on some checks, and they won't care about the "politics" around it, and they'll associate him favorably when they cash those checks.

How about Joe? Well, in the case of "people who dont know how to politick", you get [this](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/09/us/biden-administration/white-house-says-bidens-name-wont-appear-on-future-stimulus-checks).

> “He did not want his name to appear on the checks,” the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters, “and he didn’t think that was a priority.”

Neither is winning elections, Jen, apparently.

Good luck in '22!
