# Betteridge's Law of Headlines Says "What?"

[Here's](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/us/politics/democratic-fundraising.html) a fun one:

>They found that these donors were feeling more positive about Democrats in Washington than in years past, and that they remained energized — but a significant chunk of them were in fact planning to donate less, now that Trump is out of office.

If you were wondering whether the type of voter who merely votes *against* Ol' Donny Deals was a sustaining ally, or merely a friend of convenience, look no further!

Then, there's this:

>After Mr. Trump’s defeat, there have been some signs of donor burnout. Close to nine out of 10 respondents said Mr. Trump had been one of the top factors driving them to donate in recent years. And upward of one in five grass-roots donors said they were now likely to cut back on their gifts to candidates and political parties.

>The share who said they planned to increase their giving tapered down to nearly zero.

It's funny how in the pursuit of their electoral success in 2020, Democrats have milked every money-udder dry and burned every bridge they could to get their people elected. It remains to be seen if they'll manage to beat DJT in '24.

My money's on no.
