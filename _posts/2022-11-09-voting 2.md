# Speaking of Voting...

Looks like Dems didn't get absolutely rinsed, which I find pretty wild (aka surprising)!

Fetterman getting elected is funny, and clearly indicates America loves its big, large, boys. Maybe the D's should find more of those to put on the ticket in places?

It probably helps that he's left of Biden, if only slightly, because it sure seems like a lot of left-leaning referendums did well throughout the country.

Maybe it's not all doom and gloom...
