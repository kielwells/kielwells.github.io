# Movies and Cigarettes

Isn't it wild how fucking cool smoking looks in movies still? Everytime I see something set, say, pre-2005, people are casually smoking and it looks inviting and delightful and mysterious and mundane. I don't quite know why, honestly. Some unintelligble element to the actions, with a strong association with nostalgia for a world that maybe never did exist.a

Vapes just don't look the same, and we've regressed as a society for making them exist in order to wean people off cigs.
