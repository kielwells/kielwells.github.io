# Chinese Travel Limitations

People who write stuff like [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/21/business/international/china-coronavirus-borders.html) have maybe the smoothest brains of all time, I think. How on earth can you sit and look at the data about the Chinese response to COVID-19 vs the US response, and think that China's limitations for foreign entry are anything but responsible? The article itself points out the US has presently tallied up nearly **30 million** cases to China's 100k, but then makes the implication that somehow the Chinese are being crazy, anti-freedom, draconian assholes from the opening sentences:

>Leave your partner and children behind. Quarantine for up to a month. Get inoculated with a Covid-19 vaccine from China, if you can find one. And prepare yourself for an anal swab.

These people are probably surprised there's a country out there that actually takes steps to protect its people, rather than tossing them to the wolves, and so have to cope by making them out to be the bad guys via tone and out-of-context list of requirements.

I guess maybe it's evil to not want your people to be killed needlessly by a virus, if you're a nominally communist country in SE Asia.
