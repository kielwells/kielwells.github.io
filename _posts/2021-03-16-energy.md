# Clean Power

To paraphrase a saying, the best time to have built a shitload of nuclear power plants was 30 years ago; the next best time is today. Too many China hawks will watch China [try and ease their way off of coal](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/world/asia/china-coal-politics.html) as the world burns down around our ears, rather than set aside their nationalistic tendencies. The world's current superpower should be sitting down with the world's next superpower and identifying ways we can collaborate to create a future that isn't a blasted hellscape for our children, rather than vying with each other over who can produce the most widgets in a game of capitalist chicken.

China at least has the gumption to spend money on new nuclear power generation stations, unlike the US. Let us fade into senescence gracefully, rather than die jerking in fits and starts, and pass some knowledge off to the future of the world, I say.
