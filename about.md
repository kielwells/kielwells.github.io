# About Me

I am Kiel Wells. I have been following politics since prior to Obama's first presidential election. My personal predictive claim to fame is that I said Obama had a shot at being elected in 2006, well before my best friend thought America would accept a black man as president.

Joke's on both of us, because he was elected, and the country still didn't accept him!

Since then, I've watched as what feels like the world I understood has burned down around me, while I attempted to make sense of the ashes that were left. I've come to the place where I feel it is clear the US is a capitalist hell, requiring the blood of the poor to grease the machinery of profit. 

I've gone through about every evolution you can as far as politics from a left perspective can go:

  - garden-variety liberal
  - neo-liberal Nate Silver-type
  - Vox acolyte
  - Russia-gate 'truther'
  - PodSaveAmerica merch buyer
  - ChapoTrapHouse subscriber
  - CTH stealer = CURRENT LOCATION

While I think this country deserves to undergo some kind of revolution, I suspect it is too eternally oppressed for that to happen. The state of politics today is about culture, and nothing about the material aspects of improving people's lives.

Epstein definitely didn't kill himself.
