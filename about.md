# About Me

I am Kiel Wells. I have been following politics since prior to Obama's first presidential election. My personal predictive claim to fame is that I said Obama had a shot at being elected in 2006, well before my best friend thought America would accept a black man as president.

Joke's on both of us, because he was elected, and the country still didn't accept him.

I've gone through about every evolution you can as far as politics from a left perspective can go:
  - garden-variety liberal
  - neo-liberal Nate Silver-type
  - Vox acolyte
  - PodSaveAmerica merch buyer
  - ChapoTrapHouse subscriber
  - CTH stealer = CURRENT LOCATION

I think this country is about to undergo some kind of revolution, and I hope I don't get caught up in it. For politics, I currently dream of the day when my grandchildren will have me executed for being too conservative. On that day, I will die happy.
