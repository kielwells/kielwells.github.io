# About Me

I am Kiel Wells.

I'm a wanna-be tech guy, but I don't much pay attention to tech anymore. I'm a wanna-be political commentator, but politics actually sucks, so I have no interest there anymore.

I always need to read more fiction books, and play more interesting single-player games.

Recommend me something!

You can also find me on <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@kielwells">Mastodon</a> and on BlueSky @kielwells.com!
