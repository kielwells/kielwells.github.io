# Just Build Some Goddamn Trains, OK?

Let's all read some [stupid shit](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22334634/schumer-electric-vehicle-swap-discount-infrastructure-interview) that Chuck Schumer wants to do:

> “It’s a bold new plan designed to accelerate America’s transition to all electric vehicles on the road, to developing a charging infrastructure, and to grow American jobs through clean manufacturing,” Schumer told The Verge in a brief interview this week. “And the ultimate goal is to have every car manufactured in America be electric by 2030, and every car on the road be clean by 2040.”

Sure, let's electrify some cars! After that, maybe we can take a whole shitload of those cars, and link them together, and maybe give them their own special roads? Once all the cars are all linked together, maybe not every car needs an engine, cause that's probably overkill. And if they're linked, you should probably make it so people can move from car to car, cause that's just friendly! Then make them fast, and make them go everywhere!!!

China built *25000 kilometers* of high-speed rail in **12 years**, to go from last to first on a global scale. I'd much rather get into a spending pissing match with them for bigger, faster, better trains, and stop the pissing match of military spending.
