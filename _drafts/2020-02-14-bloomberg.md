# Bloomberg

He fucking sucks, folks. This guy is an authoritarian to the nth degree, and he's wanted to buy his way into the presidency for decades. His opportunism has led him to think maybe the time to do that is now, by exploiting the weakness of the Democratic Party during this contested primary, but his singular goal is power, not progress.

He does not hold dear anything the Democratic Party considers valuable except government of, by, and for the wealthy. He would be an abysmal candidate to run against Trump.

Watching the two dipshits (Mike and Donny) snipe at each other over twitter should tell an objective observer everything ether need to know; however, we still have morons like Neera Tanden fawning over Mike’s feigned quippiness like he’s the Second Coming. We don't need another billionaire in politics, we need less, and there is no such thing as a good billionaire anyway.
