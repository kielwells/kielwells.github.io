<h1>Professional Amateur</h1>

<h2>By Kiel Wells</h2>

<p>An attempt to document things I find interesting/noteworthy.</p>

<p>I am a person who spends too much time in my life reading about policy, but I’m not clever enough to post anything useful to twitter. Not only that, but I have tweets set to auto-delete, and the only people who follow me won’t retweet anything I say. Piling on a joke always feels bad and gratuitous, so I don’t do that.</p>

<p>Anyway, welcome. This exists as an outlet for me to rant, because I have no mouth, and I must scream.</p>

<p><br/>I stole that from a much better writer.</p>
